# Downgrade Express and path-to-regexp to Compatible Versions

The error you are encountering is likely due to incompatibility between Express 5 (beta) and path-to-regexp 8. To fix this, you should downgrade to stable versions known to work well together.

## Steps to Downgrade

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Change the dependencies versions as follows:

```json
"express": "^4.18.2",
"path-to-regexp": "^6.2.1"
```

3. Delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

4. Reinstall dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- Express 4.x is the latest stable major version and is widely supported.
- path-to-regexp 6.x is compatible with Express 4.x.
- Express 5 is still in beta and may cause compatibility issues with some middleware and dependencies.
- Downgrading should resolve the "Missing parameter name" error from path-to-regexp.

If you need help performing these steps, please let me know.
